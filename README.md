# webpack-doc-kit

Automated TypeScript API documentation generator for [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). Extracts type definitions from webpack's `types.d.ts` and produces Markdown and HTML documentation, deployed to GitHub Pages.

## How It Works

1. **TypeDoc** reads webpack's TypeScript type definitions
2. Custom plugins process the output (namespace merging, type mapping, themed rendering)
3. **@node-core/doc-kit** converts Markdown to HTML
4. GitHub Actions deploys the result to GitHub Pages
5. Vercel provides live preview deployments for every pull request

### Webpack Version Tracking

The `HEAD_COMMIT` file pins the exact webpack/webpack commit used for doc generation. A scheduled GitHub Action runs every 24 hours to:

1. Fetch the latest webpack `main` branch HEAD
2. Update `HEAD_COMMIT`
3. Regenerate documentation
4. Push the changes to this repository

This ensures documentation stays in sync with upstream webpack without manual intervention.

## Contributing

When making changes to documentation generation (plugins, `generate-md.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`), ensure the docs can still be generated successfully. CI will verify this on every pull request.
